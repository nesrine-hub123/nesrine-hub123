## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

â€¢	I recently graduated in Bioinformatics (B.Sc.) from UniversitÃ© Laval, with a strong background in computational biology and life sciences.  
â€¢	I am a bioinformatician in training, working on NGS analysis (RNA-Seq, scRNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq) and omics data integration.  
â€¢	I build and explore reproducible pipelines using Python, R, Docker, and Nextflow.  
â€¢	Comfortable with Linux/Unix environments, shell scripting, and command-line tools widely used in bioinformatics.  
â€¢	Interested in data visualization (ggplot2, matplotlib, plotly) and multi-omics integration.  
â€¢	Currently learning cloud computing (AWS, GCP) and HPC workflows (SLURM).  
â€¢	I aim to apply computational biology and data science to precision medicine and genomics research.  
â€¢	I am continuously learning advanced methods in machine learning for omics data.  
â€¢	Open to collaborations, internships, and projects in bioinformatics and data science.
